### Prospective pay

Until 2018, BGA gathered _prospective_ pay for public employees. This figure did not represent actual pay, nor did it include overtime or additional pay, e.g., bonuses. Prospective pay for 2016 and 2017 can be found in the `legacy/` directory.

### Actual pay

In 2018, the BGA began to request _actual_ pay for public employees in the previous year, as well as a separate figure for additional pay. This can be found in files named `2017-payroll-actual-pt-X.csv`.

#### ‼️ Note
In some cases, the data in these files has been amended by the responding agency or formatted by the BGA, i.e., it may differ from the data [displayed in the Public Salaries Database](https://salary.bettergov.org).
